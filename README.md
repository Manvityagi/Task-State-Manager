**Task State Manager** is an implementation of an upload/download system in which the functionality of pausing/resuming/terminating the task at hand is poosible.

## ‚ùì Problem  Statement
- We want to offer an implementation through which the user can stop the long-running task at any given point in time, and can choose to resume or terminate it. This will ensure that the resources like compute/memory/storage/time are used efficiently at our end, and do not go into processing tasks that have already been stopped (and then to roll back the work done post the stop-action)

## üöß  Technology Stack
- **Framework** - Django Rest Framework 
- **Database** - PostgreSQL
- **Cloud database service** - MongoDB Atlas
- **Deployment** - Heroku


# üí° Approach
### Upload 
- A dummy CSV file is read using pandas and uploaded row by row to a table in database.
    #### Pause
    Number of lines read are constantly being recorded, when paused an Interrupt Exception is raised which stops the upload.
     #### Resume
    The uplaod start funtion is called again but this time the CSV file is read from the checkpoint that we stored earlier.
    ### Terminate
    In this situation, the application needed to get back to the work done before this wrong upload started, so I dropped this particular table. 
    ### Progress
    Some basic maths is being used to calculate the percentage of upload completed.

### Download/Export
- A database tabke from the server can be exported as a CSV file.
    #### Pause
    Number of lines read are constantly being recorded, when paused an Interrupt Exception is raised which stops the export.
     #### Resume
    The downlaod start funtion is called again but this time the databse table is read from the checkpoint that we stored earlier. 
    ### Terminate
    In this situation, the application needed to get back to the work done before this wrong upload started, so I removed the exported CSV file. 
    ### Progress
    Some basic maths is being used to calculate the percentage of download completed.
